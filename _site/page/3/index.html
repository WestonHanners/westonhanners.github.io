<h1 class="article-title"><a href=/blog/2016.04.07>UITableView Storyboard Design</a></h2>

<h4 class="date-line">Published on Apr 7th, 2016</h4>

<div><p>Frequently I will come across some code for an iOS app that looks like
this.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class ViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate {
    
    func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier("basicCell", forIndexPath: indexPath)
        cell.textLabel?.text = "Some Test Data"
        return cell
    }

    func numberOfSectionsInTableView(tableView: UITableView) -&gt; Int {
        return 1
    }
    
    func tableView(tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {
        return 20
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a storyboard that looks like this.</p>

<p><img src="images/Screenshot-2016-04-06-22.38.37.png" alt="Screenshot 1" /></p>

<p>Now, there is nothing <em>wrong </em>about this, a lot of Apple code
demonstrates doing this exact thing. You insert a tableView where it is
required, implement delegate and datasource protocols, drag connections
in your storyboard and you are done, but we can do a lot better. Let’s
begin by describing two of the big issues with this particular pattern.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This tableView is not reusable, you will have to rebuild it, along
with it’s prototype cells in every screen that requires this data.</li>
  <li>Your viewController will become polluted with code to handle taps,
edits and actions for this tableView and will contribute to creating
a “Massive View Controller”</li>
</ul>

<p>Xcode has given us the tools to improve this quite a bit right off the
bat. If you look in the object browser in Xcode, you will find an object
you are unlikely to have used before.</p>

<p><img src="images/Screenshot-2016-04-06-22.33.15.png" alt="Screenshot 2" /></p>

<p>This will allow you to embed a scene from your storyboard directly into
another. Let’s see what this looks like. Start by deleting your old
tableView then dragging out a UIContainerView and setting its
constraints. You would want the container to be positioned in the exact
spot you want your tableView to be. You will notice it created a new
scene attached to it, it’s a generic UIViewController, go ahead and
delete that for now. Drag a new UITableViewController out into your
storyboard, we need to reconnect it to the container.</p>

<p><img src="images/segueconnection.gif" alt="Segue Connection" /></p>

<p>You now have a UITableViewController that can be used between multiple
scenes in your storyboard. You just set the controller’s class, stick
your delegate/datasource methods in and you are good to go. But we
aren’t done yet, in Xcode 7, Apple gave us Storyboard references. By
using references, you can embed this tableView in completely different
storyboards. Start by dragging out one of these guys into your <em>other</em>
storyboard</p>

<p><img src="images/Screenshot-2016-04-06-22.34.23.png" alt="Screenshot 4" /></p>

<p>Next you want to set its storyboard and identifier (I have my tableView
scene from the above the identifier “tableViewController”, but you can
make something more fitting for your app). The identifier here needs to
match whatever you put in your tableView scene’s “Storyboard ID”.</p>

<p><img src="images/Screenshot-2016-04-06-22.35.20.png" alt="Screenshot 5" /></p>

<p>Now you can repeat the same steps as above to create and connect a
UIContainerView to this new reference and <em>voila</em> you have embedded the
tableView here as well. I hope this helps you improve your app structure
and write less code. I was blown away when I found out how to do this.
If you have any questions, poke me on twitter and I will try to help you
out.</p>

<h1 class="article-title"><a href=/blog/2016.01.27>How to Start an iOS App Portfolio</a></h2>

<h4 class="date-line">Published on Jan 27th, 2016</h4>

<div><p>Since my post <a href="blog/2016.01.26">yesterday</a>,
the most common question I have received is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What sort of app should I build for my Portfolio?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting question. Ideally, you
would do the same thing you would if you wanted to build an app not for
a portfolio. Start by identifying a problem that you feel like you can
solve and then solve it in the best way possible. But I can imagine a
new developer might not be ready to deal with all the issues surrounding
developing an original idea from scratch. That said, my goto response is
usually “Make a Twitter app”. Twitter clients are interesting because
they will exercise a lot of the skills required to build apps in
general. I will list a few of the things I would expect a portfolio
quality Twitter app to use (or any portfolio quality app).</p>

<h2 id="it-uses-uitableview">It Uses UITableView…</h2>

<p>Most iOS apps that I have built have used UITableView in some way or
another, it’s probably the most common user interface element in a
standard app and being able to demonstrate its usage looks great when
applying for a job. This works great for building a Twitter timeline.
Try to implement swipes to add actions to your rows and make sure you
show proper cell reuse. Look up methods for paging tweets so that when
you reach the bottom of the timeline, more cells will load in.</p>

<h2 id="it-uses-http-api">It Uses HTTP API…</h2>

<p>There are not many apps for iOS that won’t need some sort of network
resource and being able to connect, authenticate and use data from a web
service is something you end up doing a lot. Now, I do think you can get
away with using the Twitter SDK, but attempting their REST web service
would really show you know how to connect to and use HTTP web services.</p>

<h2 id="it-uses-interesting-ui">It Uses Interesting UI…</h2>

<p>A lot of customers like their iOS apps to stand out and a Twitter app
presents a lot of opportunities to flex your UI building skills and make
something interesting and fun to use. Interesting UI can be anything
from some sort of custom-built button to a use of graphics and
animations to make your app feel fun and alive. Something I like to do
is look at some of the more popular apps on the AppStore and try to see
if I can duplicate some of the animations and UI elements that they use.</p>

<h2 id="it-uses-persistence-and-security">It Uses Persistence and Security…</h2>

<p>There is not much you really need to persist in a twitter app except for
one important piece, credentials. You will need to show how to store
user credentials (or more likely their token) in a secure way. Use of
the Keychain API is your friend here and while it’s a bit of a pain to
learn, it’s better than leaking user data and putting accounts at risk.
Don’t take security lightly</p>

<h2 id="it-is-relatively-simple-to-build">It is relatively simple to build…</h2>

<p>A Twitter app doesn’t take a year to build, so you can probably whip one
out in a week or two if you can find the time to sit down and code.
Portfolio apps don’t need to be big complex pieces of software, iOS
tends to work best with simple apps and so it’s perfectly fine to build
simple apps for your portfolio. Twitter is just one of the things I like
to suggest because it touches so many commonly used parts of iOS. If you
are still wanting more, here are a few other ideas to get your gears
turning.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notes app ( Demonstrates text manipulation, bonus points for iCloud
syncing the notes)</li>
  <li>Where Did I Park? (An app to mark places on a map and store them for
later, demonstrate the use of the location API)</li>
  <li>Painting App (Demonstrates use of Touch and Graphics API)</li>
  <li>Alarm Clock (Use local notification and audio playback)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever you decide to build, try to follow some sort of style guide and
make your code as clean and easy to read as possible, you will want to
to be something you can print out and show to recruiters if need-be.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Build an app that is simple, yet uses as many common iOS
features as possible. Make it as pretty as you can, and polish to a
shine. Repeat till you have a couple of apps under your belt.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>

<h1 class="article-title"><a href=/blog/2016.01.26>How to become an entry level iOS developer</a></h2>

<h4 class="date-line">Published on Jan 26th, 2016</h4>

<div><p>I have been mentoring some friends who are interested in a career in
iOS development, and was asked to come up with some sort of list of what
they should know to get started. This seems like a good topic for a blog
post, so without (much) further ado, I give you my list of what you
should know to become an Entry Level iOS Developer.</p>

<h2 id="basic-cs-knowledge">Basic CS Knowledge</h2>

<p>I don’t believe that being a computer science PHD is a requirement for
getting into mobile application development, In my experience, heavy CS
concepts don’t often come up in day-to-day work, but a lot of employers
still like to run their interviewees through CS puzzles. So, for the
novice, I would recommend watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T383Xfn0zECHrOTpfOSlptPAB">Harvard CS50 courses on YouTube</a>
as a great place to get started, they are easy to follow and actually
pretty interesting to watch.</p>

<p>If you are planning to interview with one of the big companies like
Google or Apple, you might benefit by picking up a couple algorithm
books to study.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Fourth-Edition/dp/145157827X">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>
by Gayle Leekman</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202">The Algorithm Design Manual</a>
by Steven S. Skiena</p>

<h2 id="swift-or-objective-c">Swift or Objective-C</h2>

<p>You don’t have to be an expert, but you should be able to write in at
least one of these languages without having to look up syntax very
often. Just get yourself to a point where you can write classes,
structs, loops, functions, assign variables and evaluate expressions
without help.</p>

<p>Right now we are in a strange time where it’s still acceptable to be
hired only knowing Objective-C. Swift is pretty new and unless you are
applying for a company that has a lot of project turnover, you will
mostly be writing in Objective-C anyways. That said, there are plenty of
companies taking the plunge to Swift (including the one I work for) and
I don’t think it will be too difficult to find a job if it’s the only
language you know. The important thing is to be fairly proficient in
whichever you choose, and get familiar enough with the other that you
can at least read the code.</p>

<h2 id="frameworks-and-api">Frameworks and API</h2>

<p>Cocoa Touch is updated yearly and with it things come and go. It is not
unusual for me to work with the Apple Documentation open most of the
time; there is just too damn much to try to keep in your head.</p>

<p>I don’t think its necessary that you memorize all of the iOS API’s, but
you should have a good idea of what is available to you, and be fluent
in a few of the big ones.</p>

<p><strong>UIKit</strong> (IUViewController, UITableView, UIButton,
UINavigationController, GestureRecognizers)</p>

<p><strong>Interface Builder</strong> (Storyboards, Segues, and the odd .xib)</p>

<p><strong>Foundation Types</strong> (NSArray, NSDictionary, NSString) and their Swift
counterparts (Array, Dictionary and String)</p>

<p><strong>HTTP API</strong> (NSURLSession, Basic REST API concepts, JSON Parsing with
NSJSONSerialization)</p>

<p><strong>Grand Central Dispatch</strong> (GCD, NSOperationQueue)</p>

<p><strong>Persistence</strong> (NSCoding, NSUserDefaults, CoreData)</p>

<p><strong>Memory Management</strong> (what Retain Cycles are and ARC fundamentals)</p>

<p>Third-Party frameworks can also fun, but try to not depend on them too
much; if it’s something I can do myself, I usually do.</p>

<h2 id="development-patterns">Development Patterns</h2>

<p>Patterns are important, they make development easier and they make your
code cleaner. Make sure you understand these basic patterns, they are
used A LOT in the iOS Frameworks and it is not likely that you will be
able to do much without knowing them. There are many more, but you can
learn those as you go.</p>

<p><strong>Delegation</strong> (This is sort of the workhorse of most iOS API’s, you
should DEFINITELY understand this)</p>

<p><strong>Model View Controller</strong> (MVC, I don’t think Apple did the best job of
encouraging best MVC separation, but it’s an important pattern that can
help improve your code if you take the time to implement it properly.
Also, it’s pretty much guaranteed to be on any iOS interviewer’s
question list.)</p>

<p><strong>Subclassing or Object-Oriented Programming</strong> (The most part you will
be writing apps in this style)</p>

<p><strong>Singleton</strong> (This one can definitely be abused… use sparingly.)</p>

<h2 id="familiarity-with-the-environment">Familiarity with the Environment</h2>

<p>This might seem obvious, but if you don’t have a Mac, get one! If you
don’t have an iOS device, get one! While it’s not impossible to get
started just writing apps for the simulator, you will eventually want a
real device for development. As for computer, it’s gonna be pretty hard
to learn Xcode without a mac to run it on. I started out with a 2009
MacBook Pro 13″ and a first-gen iPod Touch. It is quite possible to get
by with the lower end devices to start, it was nearly a $1500
investment, but totally worth it in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="uxui">UX/UI</h2>

<p>All mobile developers should at least know some of the basic concepts of
design. You should know the difference between mockups and wireframes
and how to use both in your development process. Knowing what Apple
considers usable UI will help as well; for this you will definately want
to read the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a></p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>You should be familiar with a few of the common development tools.</p>

<p><strong>Xcode</strong> (of course)</p>

<p><strong>Source Control</strong> (Git, Subversion or Mercurial… probably just git
though)</p>

<p><strong>Issue Tracking Software</strong> (JIRA is the big one here, but there are
others. Just play with some of them if you can.)</p>

<h2 id="opinions">Opinions</h2>

<p>Having an opinion about iOS, Swift, or even a specific API is a great
way for interviewers to understand how deep your knowledge about a topic
goes. It also allows us to see your passion. If you are having an
interview and you are asked, “So what do you think of Swift?” saying
“It’s alright, I guess” is not the correct answer, you should tell them
what you think of optionals, how you like using a specific feature.
There aren’t many wrong answers here, the important thing is to have
something to say.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>

<p>Actions can speak louder than words. If you really want to nail that
interview, put together a couple of simple apps (or even better, launch
them on the AppStore); they really like to see that you have the ability
to complete a project. GitHub is nice too, but make sure your code is
easy for the interviewers to compile if they wanna test it out.</p>

<p>If you are wanting more resources to get started, please checkout my
<a href="resources/">iOS Developer Resources</a> page where I link to blogs and pages I found helpful
when I started out.</p>

<p>I guess the last thing I would add is JUST DO IT! Right now iOS
developers are in high demand and if you can get yourself to a decent
skill level, you won’t be without work for a while. It’s a rewarding job
that allows you to practice both engineering skills and creativity.</p>

<h1 class="article-title"><a href=/blog/2015.11.10>Per-View Auto-Rotation Locking Made Easy for iOS 8 and 9</a></h2>

<h4 class="date-line">Published on Nov 10th, 2015</h4>

<div><p>This week I was working on an app where the client wanted to lock the
app rotation to Portrait on some screens and Landscape on others.
Luckily I had built all of my views in AutoLayout so they already
supported the required layouts, I just needed to lock them. Rotation
API’s are one of the most frequently deprecated parts of UIKit so when I
started working on this, I had to look it up, and let me say, it’s
pretty noisy out there. After an hour or so of research and another hour
or two of experimentation, I finally boiled it down to two parts.</p>

<p>Select ALL POSSIBLE interface orientations you plan to support in your Info.plist.</p>

<p><img src="images/InterfaceOrientation.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Then you <em>really</em> only have to implement one method.</p>

<h2 id="swift-12">Swift 1.2</h2>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>override func supportedInterfaceOrientations() -&gt; Int {
    return Int(UIInterfaceOrientationMask.Portrait.rawValue)
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="swift-20">Swift 2.0</h2>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>override func supportedInterfaceOrientations() -&gt; UIInterfaceOrientationMask {
    return UIInterfaceOrientationMask.Portrait
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Making sure to select Portrait or Landscape depending on what you want.
This is probably one of the messiest API transitions I have seen
recently and it took me a while to actually notice what I kept doing
wrong in Swift 1.2. (that Int cast is ugly)</p>

<h1 class="article-title"><a href=/blog/2015.10.29>If-Let Assignment Operator</a></h2>

<h4 class="date-line">Published on Oct 29th, 2015</h4>

<div><blockquote>
  <p>This article was updated on 12/06/2017 to account for Swift 4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many times have you had to implement this pattern?</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if let value = someOptionalValue as? String {
    self.value = value
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I use this all the time when parsing through JSON or implementing
NSCoding and I think its a little over verbose for Swift, I felt sure
there was a better way. <a href="http://nshipster.com/swift-operators/">NSHipster</a> mentions a logical OR assignment
operator (||=) which would be perfect however, it doesn’t seem to be
implemented for generics <em>(Please let me know if I am wrong here)</em>. I
thought I would give it a try…</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>precedencegroup AssignmentPrecedence {
    associativity: right
}

infix operator ?= : AssignmentPrecedence

func ?=&lt;T&gt;(left: inout T, right: T?) {
    if let value = right {
        left = value
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It actually worked quite well, I was able to reduce the original code to
this</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>self.value ?= someOptionalValue as? String
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Might not be the biggest win, but when you have several of these
assignments in a row, it saves a lot of code and makes it much more
readable. One more thing… and I am still trying to figure out exactly
what is going on here, but I ended up having to define a second function
to assign to optionals. The only difference is the left parameter now is
T?</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>func ?=&lt;T&gt;(left: inout T?, right: T?) {
    if let value = right {
        left = value
    }
}

var someOptionalString: String?

someOptionalString ?= newValue // Will assign when newValue is not optional
</code></pre></div></div>
