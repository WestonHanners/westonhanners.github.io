If you work in software you are guaranteed to eventually attend a conference call at some point, and to be frank, some people are terrible at this. You will hear noise in the background, people won’t pay attention or you constantly have technical blunders.

So I decided to put together a list of tips for improving your conference experience. I hope you enjoy it.

# Join on time
When you schedule a meeting, it’s not just a suggestion, you are taking up peoples time. if you fail to join people who could otherwise be doing useful work are instead waiting in dead silence for the call to begin. If you MUST be late, make sure you send out a notification as early as possible to let them know of your delay. Even better, update the calendar invite with a new start time.

# Find a good meeting space
This one sounds obvious, but try to make every effort to obtain a quiet space to have your meeting. Conference rooms are the best choice, but barring that, any quiet space will do. 

Also be aware that while it may be quiet for you, you will be potentially making the space less quiet for other people. Avoid taking calls at your desk if you are in an open office.

If it is nice outside and you are the only caller from your end, it can sometimes be nice to go for a walk. I have taken calls on city walking trails and parking garages before. This might not be ideal for every call, but it’s a good option to have.

# Sound
If you are taking the call alone, use headphones. These typically sound better because the microphone is close to your mouth, but be mindful you don’t move around much if it is laying against your shirt.

Mute yourself when you are not speaking. Learn how to mute your call in the software you use and make liberal use of that button.

If you are taking a call with multiple people, avoid using Laptop microphones. Also be aware they can pick up the sound of every keystroke if you are typing while talking.

# Pay Attention
If you aren’t presenting or on camera, it can be easy to pull out your phone and browse reddit or stare blankly out a window, but try to pay attention having to ask “wait, what did you say again” can be really embarrassing.

For meeting hosts, try to stay on topic and keep people involved in the conversation, this will prevent wandering minds.

# Keep your desktop clean
If you are going to be sharing your screen, make sure your desktop is not cluttered. Take special care to remove documents with confidential or private information. Remove that funny meme your friend sent you. Just make sure your desktop has nothing that will embarrass you or your company.

# Open Questions
Try to avoid asking “who wants to go first” or leave questions open to any random person to answer. If you do, one of three things are going to happen.

1. Multiple people answer at the same time and they talk over each other
2. No one talks and you get dead air and have to direct your question at a specific person anyways.
3. What you want to happen, happens and the correct person and only that person answers. 

You get a 1/3 chance for it to work, It’s awkward and just don’t do it.
