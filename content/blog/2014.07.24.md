Title: Format specifiers for NSInteger and NSUInteger (Without Warnings)

    %zd = NSInteger
    %tu = NSUInteger
    %tx = Hex

I have been bothered by the fact that if I use NSInteger NSUInteger in
\[NSString stringWithFormat:\], I will get warnings depending on what
architecture I am building for.

Does this look familiar?\[/caption\] You can change the format to %ld
and the cast to (long), but that felt really ackward. After googling
around for a while and even (link: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Strings/Articles/formatSpecifiers.html text: Apple's Documetation)
is not helping much, I decided to pose the question in \#iphonedev. I got a
response from someone named "Jer" with the following (link: https://twitter.com/gparker/status/377910611453046784 text: link) 
Gred Parker describes the %zd (NSInteger), %tu (NSUInteger) and %tx (Hex) format
specifiers which will suppress the warnings when switching architectures. 
I immediately double-checked the docsÂ to
make sure I hadn't overlooked something, and I had not. So I filed a bug
report with Apple and hopefully this will get cleared up soonish. In the
mean time I decided to make this blog post, to help Google, help others.
