Title: Format specifiers for NSInteger and NSUInteger (Without Warnings)

    %zd = NSInteger
    %tu = NSUInteger
    %tx = Hex

I have been bothered by the fact that if I use NSInteger NSUInteger in
\[NSString stringWithFormat:\], I will get warnings depending on what
architecture I am building for.

You can change the format to `%ld` and the cast to (long), but that felt really 
awkward. After googling around for a while and even [Apple's Documentation][2]
is not helping much, I decided to pose the question in \#iphonedev. I got a
response from someone named "Jer" with the following [link][3] Gred Parker 
describes the `%zd (NSInteger)`, `%tu (NSUInteger)` and `%tx (Hex)` format
specifiers which will suppress the warnings when switching architectures. 

I immediately double-checked the docsÂ to
make sure I hadn't overlooked something, and I had not. So I filed a bug
report with Apple and hopefully this will get cleared up soonish. In the
mean time I decided to make this blog post, to help Google, help others.
