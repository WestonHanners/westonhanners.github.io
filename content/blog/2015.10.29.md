How many times have you had to implement this pattern

code=swift
if let value = someOptionalValue as? String {
    self.value = value
}
==!

I use this all the time when parsing through JSON or implementing
NSCoding and I think its a little over verbose for Swift, I felt sure
there was a better way. (link: http://nshipster.com/swift-operators/ text: NSHipster) mentions a logical OR assignment
operator (||=) which would be perfect however, it doesn't seem to be
implemented for generics *(Please let me know if I am wrong here)*. I
thought I would give it a try...

code=swift
infix operator ||= { associativity right precedence 90 }

func ||= (inout left: T, right: T?) {
    if let right = right {
        left = right
    }
}
==!

It actually worked quite well, I was able to reduce the original code to
this

code=swift
self.value ||= someOptionalValue as? String
==!

Might not be the biggest win, but when you have several of these
assignments in a row, it saves a lot of code and makes it much more
readable. One more thing... and I am still trying to figure out exactly
what is going on here, but I ended up having to define a second function
to assign to optionals. The only difference is the left parameter now is
T?

code=swift
func ||= (inout left: T?, right: T?) { // The left param is now Optional
    if let right = right {
        left = right
    }
}

var someOptionalString: String?

someOptionalString ||= newValue // Will assign when newValue is not optional
==!

If you are interested in seeing this in action, here is the

(Note this was tested on Swift 2.0)

**UPDATE 11/01/2015:** I was
notified by twitter that ||= is equal to left = left || right in ruby
and what I am trying to do is left = right || left. I was not aware of
this usage, to avoid confusion, I would  probably use another operator
?=.

code=swift
infix operator ?= { associativity right precedence 90 }

func ?=<T>(inout left: T, right: T?) {
    if let value = right {
        left = value
    }
}

func ?=<T>(inout left: T?, right: T?) {
    if let value = right {
        left = value
    }
}
==!
