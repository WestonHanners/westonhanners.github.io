My name is Weston Hanners and I am an iOS Engineer for [Y Media
Labs](http://www.ymedialabs.com) in Downtown Indianapolis. I am a big
fan of H.P. Lovecraft, Japan, Gaming, and Technology. I am married with
two kids. I am very interested in improving myself and with this blog I
hope to educate others while I learn. I can't really think of much else
to stick here. If you are interested you can check out my [LinkedIn
profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lhanners "LinkedIn Profile").
