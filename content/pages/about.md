<div markdown="1" class="center-text">
My name is Weston Hanners and I am a Mobile Software Craftsman 
for [Y Media Labs][2] in Downtown Indianapolis.

I have been working with Objective-C since 2010 and Swift since 2014.
Since then I have had the pleasure of working with many great developers and
clients.

I hope the thoughts and learnings I share through this blog will help others 
like me along their journey.

Here are some places you can find me around the web...
