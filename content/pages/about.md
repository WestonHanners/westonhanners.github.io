![Mothership][1]

<center-text>
My name is Weston Hanners and I am a Mobile Software Craftsman 
for [Y Media Labs][2] in Downtown Indianapolis.

I am not here to be a code monkey, I am not here to collect a paycheck.

I am here to build great things and make a difference, and I will not be 
deterred. 

The plan is to use this blog to share the things I learn with the world, 
My hope is that you will find it as interesting as I do.

Here are some places you can find me around the web...
