My name is Weston Hanners and I am an iOS Engineer for [Y Media Labs](http://www.ymedialabs.com) in Downtown Indianapolis. 

I am a male 30-something who is into Japan, Gaming, and Technology. I live with my wife and kids in southern Indiana. 

I am very interested in improving myself and with this blog I hope to educate others while I learn. 
I can't really think of much else to stick here.

Here are some places you can find me around the web:
