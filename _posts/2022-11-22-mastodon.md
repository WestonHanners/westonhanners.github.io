I think the past few weeks have had everyone thinking where are we going with
Elon Musk taking control of Twitter.

Like many I have had two concerns on the top of my mind.

1. Should I delete my account.
2. Where are we going.

In addressing the first issue, I went ahead and requested my Twitter data 
archive. It was time consuming, but not at all difficult. But as my hand hovered
over the delete button, I was suddenly reminded of all the sites I have signed
into with my Twitter credentials. With this in mind, I have decided I would hold
off on the full account deletion and will simply let it lie dormant.

The second issue was a bit more interesting. I, along with most of the 
tech-savvy internet, was immediately reminded of [Mastodon][2]. This 
decentralized, hub-based social network has been around for some years, but
mostly a small niche community. Since I last checked, it looks like they have
really improved their feature set and at this point, I didn't seriously consider
any other options. I have a new profile set up [here][1].

The cool thing about Mastodon is that you can join "hubs" that are interesting
to you, and there are no shortages of niche communities. I joined [Tech Hub][3]
and I have really been enjoying the local posts.

I think this is likely to be confusing to many people so I want to clarify some
of my initial questions here.

Be warned, I am still fairly new to Mastodon, but this is my understanding.

## What is affected by my hub choice?

Short answer: not much.

Your hub choice will determine your "local" feed content, on a typical
configuration this will be all posts from your hub.

Your "home" feed is a list of all the accounts you follow and can be from your
hub or any other hub that isn't explicitly blocked.

Finally there is a "federated" feed that is a unified feed from your hub and any
hub yours is working (or federated) with. You might see some people refer to 
this graph of connections as the "Fediverse".

I think the biggest issue would be if you chose a hub that gets defederated. 
This has happened with some hub with extreme political, violent, or sexual 
content. If you choose poorly the good news is you can always just pack up and 
move to a different hub.

## What client should I use on mobile?

I've tried a handful of iOS clients, but so far my favorite on iPhone is
[Metatext][5] but a close second is [Toot!][4]. My biggest issue with Toot! is I
think it over did it a tiny bit with the animations. There is an official client
but I found it a bit sluggish and buggy.

## How do I find my friends?

This is probably one of the biggest conversion friction points, especially with 
many hubs rate limiting rapid follows. With multiple hubs and no verification it
can be difficult to determine if you are following the right person. I do 
recommend using [fedifinder][7] to help locating your friends. I've heard there
is an open ticket to resolve this issue, but I haven't been able to locate it.

## What are these Metadata fields?

They are for whatever you like, you can add any additional information that you
think is useful for you profile. I personally put my twitter link, web site and 
location.

## Tidbits

Not everyone will be onboard for calling posts "toots", the MetaText client has
an option for renaming toot to post.

I think they also need to make it easier to follow people from a web link. 
Right now you have to copy the users profile link and paste it in your own hub
to follow, it's weird and unnecesary, I hope they figure it out soon.

Oh yea, follow [Feditips][6]. This account posts frequent tips and tricks and
has been a great resource for getting started.

## Conclusion

Mastdon is really interesting and I am going all in, I do think that some people
will have trouble "getting it" but maybe with some more updates and more 
traction we can finally ditch the monolithic corporate social network.

I hear a bunch of people are heading to [Hive Social][9], and maybe it will
become a big thing, but after MySpace, Frendster, Foursquare and now Twitter...
I think I am content to stick with Mastodon.
