![swift 1-point-no][3]

I came across an excellent [article][1] by Erica Sadun talking about her
experiences with the Xcode Betas and her expectations of Swift 1.0, and I think
it was a nice dose of reality. (…And not only because I have a domain that will
be obsolete in a post Objective-C world.)

It’s nice to pretend that we will all be writing Swift apps by the end of the
year, but if this [git repo][2] is any indication, we will have a little while
to go before the language is stable enough for prime time.

I feel sorry for all the people who decided that Swift was their excuse to start
learning iOS development, because of all the strange quirks with Objective-C
compatibility, it won’t be as easy as picking up a Swift book and writing an
app. There will be challenges and changes for at least the next year and
possibly longer. As it is now, you will have to update your Swift apps very
often to keep up with what will certainly be many revisions of the language.

I have a friend who I am trying to teach iOS development, and even though it
will be available fairly soon, I have urged him to pretend that Swift doesn’t
exist for the time being, and I urge the same to anyone else just starting out.

I intend to practice what I preach, while I will undoubtably tinker with Swift
over the next several months (I am not completely nuts), I will not do any
serious writing in it until they at least start updating the Cocoa API’s to be
a bit more Swift-like.
