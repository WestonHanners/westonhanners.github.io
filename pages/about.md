![Weston's Headshot][1]

# Who am I?

My name is Weston Hanners and I am a Mobile Software Craftsman, Servant Leader
for [Y Media Labs][2] in central Indiana.

I specialize in User Interfaces, UX, Accessibility and Design in iOS.

I have been working with Objective-C since 2010 and Swift since 2014.
Since then I have had the pleasure of working with many great developers and
clients.

I hope the thoughts and learnings I share through this blog will help others 
like me along their journey.
